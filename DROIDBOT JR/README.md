<h1>DROIDBOT JR Project</h1>

This robot was designed for classroom and camp usage by those users who only own a 31313 set.  All the standard 31313 builds are animals, humanoids, or other interesting designs, but not optimal for teaching programming systematically.  DBJ uses only a minimal number of parts and is very compact.  The color sensor is well shielded.

The handle is a key part of this design and especially useful for younger students. We include this handle in all our designs for classroom robots.
