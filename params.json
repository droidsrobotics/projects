{"name":"Robotics Projects by Sanjay and Arvind","tagline":"Current Projects","body":"### Overview of some of our projects. \r\n[STEAM with LEGO MINDSTORMS Video](https://youtu.be/ZaOk9H-Z3S4)\r\n\r\n### M3LODY MAK3R\r\nUsing LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 and EV3-G code, you can create a robot that combines art, music and robotics. Students create their music on a strip of paper which is fed into the robot. <br> \r\n[See this robot in action on YouTube.](https://youtu.be/6ymDTEkohkw) <br>\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/droidsrobotics/projects/tree/master/M3LODY%20MAK3R\">Project Downloads</a> <br>\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droidsrobotics/projects/master/images/M3LODYMAK3R.png)\r\n\r\n### PIX3L PLOTT3R\r\nBuild a working printer using LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 and ev3dev. It is programmed in Python.  Everything is made of LEGO except the paper and the pen! You can use this robot to print any image: photos, drawings, logos, etc. \r\n[See this robot in action on YouTube.](https://youtu.be/O449N-ttY7E) <br>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/PIX3LPLOTT3R/\">Project Facebook Page</a> <br>\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/droidsrobotics/projects/tree/master/PIX3L%20PLOTT3R\">Project Downloads</a>\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droidsrobotics/projects/master/images/PIX3LPLOTT3Rimage1.png)\r\n\r\n### DROIDBOT JR (DBJ)\r\nDroidBot JR. is our classroom robot design that uses only parts from the EV3 31313 set. It is a very compact and robust design. The handle is intended for students to easily hold the robot. <br>\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/droidsrobotics/projects/tree/master/DROIDBOT%20JR\">Project Downloads</a> <br>\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droidsrobotics/projects/master/images/DroidJR2.png)\r\n\r\n### ROVER\r\nThis is challenging programming project that involves one robot creating a map with an ultrasonic sensor and sending this map to another robot.  The second robot uses the information and decides on which path to take.\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/droidsrobotics/projects/tree/master/ROVER\">Project Details</a> <br>\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droidsrobotics/projects/master/images/DSC01376%20(1).JPG)\r\n\r\n\r\n### About the Creators\r\nThese robotics projects are by Sanjay and Arvind Seshan from Pittsburgh, PA, USA. We are two middle schoolers who enjoy programming robots. We are the founders of <a href=\"http://www.ev3lessons.com\">EV3Lessons.com</a> and members of a FIRST LEGO League Team <a href=\"http://www.droidsrobotics.org\">Not the Droids You Are Looking For</a>. \r\n\r\n### Contact Us\r\nHave questions, comments or anything to share? Email us at team@droidsrobotics.org. We would love to see photographs if you build one of our robots.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
