This robot was one of the most challenging programming projects we have worked on. It involved an EV3 making a map using the ultrasonic sensor and sending it via bluetooth to another robot which would then make a decision based on the information.  A Rover would explore the area and find the path that was not blocked.  It would send a message via bluetooth to a second robot and let it know which path to take. The rover sent the second robot a map.
