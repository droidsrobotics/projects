This robot was designed as a STEAM activity for K-4. It combines art, music and robotics. Students can build a robot that plays music.

### Step 1: Build the robot <br>
For building instructions, click on the folder named "building".  You can access the .lxf file.  .lxf files can be opened with LEGO digital designer which is a free software from LEGO.  Once inside you can view the build in detail or ask the software to generate building instructions for you. Download LEGO Digital Designer here: <a href="http://ldd.lego.com/">LDD</a>

### Step 2: Get the notes for your song <br>
  Samples: <br>
    Mary Had a Little Lamb: EDCD EEE DDD EGG EDCD EEE EDDEDC <br>
    Row Row Row Your Boat: CCCDE EDEFG CCC GGG EEE CCC GFEDG <br>
    Twinkle Twinkle Little Star: CC GG AA G FF EE DD C <br>
    Happy Birthday: DDED GF DDED AG <br>

### Step 3: Create a Key <br>

### Step 4: Color the Strip <br>
Make sure that students color in a bar about as wide as the color sensor. The bars should be approximately in the center of the page (ie. they must be under the color sensor once you insert the paper into the feeder. For younger students you might want to mark the location and bar size ahead of time. Sample Completed Songs: <a href="https://github.com/droidsrobotics/projects/blob/master/images/SampleMusic.JPG">Strips<a>
  
### Step 5: Write Code <br>
Depending upon the age of the students, you can either use the Basic code (which only uses switches, loops, sound blocks and a medium motor block) or more Advanced code (which also uses arrays, etc.)  Note: Basic code has been added to this project page. The more advanced code will be added soon.
