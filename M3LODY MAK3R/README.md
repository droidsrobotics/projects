This robot was designed as a STEAM activity for K-4. It combines art, music and robotics.  Students can build a robot that plays music. For building instructions, click on the folder named "building".  You can access the .lxf file.  .lxf files can be opened with LEGO digital designer which is a free software from LEGO.  Once inside you can view the build in detail or ask the software to generate building instructions for you.
